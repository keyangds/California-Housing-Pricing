# California-Housing-Pricing
Using California Housing Price dataset to compare the performance between traditional linear regression and shrinkage method <br/>
To be more specific, I seperately fit the model based on trational linear regression, lasso regression and ridge regression <br/>
1. Based on the result of MSE and R^2, the performance of shrinkage method is better than traditional linear regression. <br/>
2 .Based on the final model, shrinkage method has stronger power to penalize the insiginificant variables than traditional linear regression <br/>
3. Futhermore, due to lasso regression's penalty form is absolute value, lasso regression is capable to remove some insigificant variables
